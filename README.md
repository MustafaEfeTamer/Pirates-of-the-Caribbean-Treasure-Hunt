the purpose of the game : The character must start from a point and collect all the treasures on the map, but when he collects all the treasures, he must have traveled the shortest path at the end of the program. This is achieved with the shortest path algorithm we have established.


##### When the program is first launched, an interface with a button named "Go to Game Screen" and an image from the movie Pirates of the Caribbean greets us. If we click the button, it will take us to the game screen.
